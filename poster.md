# Guidelines to Efficiently Write Software Code with AI Assistants (Poster)

This document contains suggestions and guidelines on how to leverage AI assistants to write software code efficiently.

## Poster Overview

Below is a summarized view of the guidelines for efficient AI-assisted coding, presented in a poster format.

### Think Localized vs. Comprehensive

    <p>When working on software development tasks, select the right tool based on the scope of your work. Use file-specific tools like GitHub Copilot for focused tasks within a single file, and tools like ChatGPT or Claude for comprehensive, multi-file projects. Remember, ChatGPT and Claude may need constant reprompting, but the broader perspective they provide is invaluable for complex tasks.</p>

### Start with a Comprehensive Prompt

    <p>When starting a coding session, craft a detailed and comprehensive prompt. Clearly outline the purpose of the code, the technologies you are using, and any dependencies involved. A well-thought-out prompt ensures the AI has all the necessary context, leading to more accurate and relevant code generation throughout the session.</p>

### One Task Per Session

    <p>To maintain clarity and improve the quality of AI-generated code, focus on one task per session. For projects with multiple components, such as frontend, backend, and data layer, handle each in separate AI sessions to avoid context pollution and ensure accurate, contextually appropriate assistance.</p>

### Think Step-by-Step

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <img src="images/Think%20Step-by-Step.png" alt="Think Step-by-Step" style="width: 120px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>Adopt a step-by-step approach for tasks involving creative problem-solving. Break down work into smaller, manageable tasks to maintain control over the development process. This method ensures more precise AI guidance and allows you to integrate useful code incrementally while avoiding errors.</p>

### Update AI with Latest Context

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">

    <p>AI assistants may not always be up-to-date with the latest versions of tools or frameworks. Provide the AI with additional context, like documentation or code snippets, to ensure it generates code aligned with current standards. Clearly state your preferences to guide the AI in maintaining consistency across your project.</p>
