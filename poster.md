# Guidelines to Efficiently Write Software Code with AI Assistants

This document contains suggestions and guidelines on how to leverage AI assistants to write software code efficiently.

## Poster Overview

Below is a summarized view of the guidelines for efficient AI-assisted coding, presented in a poster format.

### Think Localized vs. Comprehensive

    <p>When working on software development tasks, select the right tool based on the scope of your work. Use file-specific tools like GitHub Copilot for focused tasks within a single file, and tools like ChatGPT or Claude for comprehensive, multi-file projects. Remember, ChatGPT and Claude may need constant reprompting, but the broader perspective they provide is invaluable for complex tasks.</p>

### Start with a Comprehensive Prompt

    <p>When starting a coding session, craft a detailed and comprehensive prompt. Clearly outline the purpose of the code, the technologies you are using, and any dependencies involved. A well-thought-out prompt ensures the AI has all the necessary context, leading to more accurate and relevant code generation throughout the session.</p>

### One Task Per Session

    <img src="images/One%20Task%20Per%20Session.png" alt="One Task Per Session" style="width: 120px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>To maintain clarity and improve the quality of AI-generated code, focus on one task per session. For projects with multiple components, such as frontend, backend, and data layer, handle each in separate AI sessions to avoid context pollution and ensure accurate, contextually appropriate assistance.</p>
</div>

### Think Step-by-Step

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <img src="images/Think%20Step-by-Step.png" alt="Think Step-by-Step" style="width: 120px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>Adopt a step-by-step approach for tasks involving creative problem-solving. Break down work into smaller, manageable tasks to maintain control over the development process. This method ensures more precise AI guidance and allows you to integrate useful code incrementally while avoiding errors.</p>
</div>

### Update AI with Latest Context

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <img src="images/Update%20AI%20with%20Latest%20Context.png" alt="Update AI with Latest Context" style="width: 120px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>AI assistants may not always be up-to-date with the latest versions of tools or frameworks. Provide the AI with additional context, like documentation or code snippets, to ensure it generates code aligned with current standards. Clearly state your preferences to guide the AI in maintaining consistency across your project.</p>

### Revisit Chat History When Necessary

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <img src="images/Revisit%20Chat%20History%20When%20Necessary.png" alt="Revisit Chat History When Necessary" style="width: 120px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>If your development process takes an unexpected turn or the AI gets stuck in a loop, revisit the chat history to find where things went off track. By refining the prompt at that point, you can reset the context and guide the AI back on the right path, ensuring more accurate and useful code generation.</p>
</div>

### Ask for Comments and Explanations

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <img src="images/Ask%20for%20Comments%20and%20Explanations.png" alt="Ask for Comments and Explanations" style="width: 120px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>Request detailed comments in AI-generated code to gain better insight into its logic and structure. If needed, ask for more detailed explanations to clarify complex sections. This practice enhances your understanding and eases future modifications.</p>
</div>

### Leverage AI for Diverse Coding Tasks

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <img src="images/Leverage%20AI%20for%20Diverse%20Coding%20Tasks.png" alt="Leverage AI for Diverse Coding Tasks" style="width: 120px; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p>AI assistants are valuable across a wide range of coding activities beyond just generating code. Use AI for tasks like writing and reviewing database scripts, code reviews, understanding unfamiliar code, creating functions, discussing software patterns, standardizing modules, documenting code, and writing tests. This broad utilization streamlines development and ensures high-quality, well-documented code.</p>
